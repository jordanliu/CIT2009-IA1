                    <p>Cyberstalking is the use of the Internet or other electronic means to stalk or harass an individual, group, or organization. (Oxford University Press, n.d.) It may include false accusations, defamation, slander and libel. It may also include monitoring, identity theft, threats, vandalism, solicitation for sex, or gathering information that may be used to threaten, embarrass or harass.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Harassment</strong>: Web technologies have enabled online groups of anonymous people to self-organize to target individuals with online defamation, threats of violence and technology-based attacks. These include publishing lies and doctored photographs, threats of rape and other violence, posting sensitive personal information about victims, e-mailing damaging statements about victims to their employers, and manipulating search engines to make damaging material about the victim more prominent. Victims frequently respond by adopting pseudonyms or going offline entirely. (Citron, 2009)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Impersonating someone on the internet is easy, harassing someone on the internet is even easier. The internet enables offenders to harass victims while being anonymous with malicious intentions.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Identity Theft</strong>: Identity theft is a serious crime that can have damaging and far-reaching effects for its victims. By stealing your identity, a person may access your bank account, obtain credit cards or loans in your name, and potentially ruin your credit rating and reputation. But consequences go beyond financial and reputational impacts and can be just as serious. For example, using your identity someone could wrongly claim government benefits in your name (serious fraud); use your name to plan or commit criminal activity; or pretend to be you in order to embarrass or misrepresent you, such as through social media. (Australian Government, n.d.)
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Through the use of Social Engineering, a person can easily impersonate being another person on the internet. All it takes is time and research. As a result, victims of identity theft are prone to defamation, fraud, etc.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <p><strong>Predators</strong>: Internet-facilitated sex crimes against minors involve deceit and begin with adults communicating with children over the Internet with the goal of coercing them into illegal sexual activity. Sometimes the sexual abuse happens face to face (Microsoft Corporation, 2008).
                                    
                                    <p>The internet enables predators to lure on victims using the internet. From being anonymous and using psuedonyms on chat rooms or using social engineering to manipulate victims to assume they are someone who they aren't.</p>
