                    <p>According to Greenberg, the dark web is the World Wide Web content that exists on darknets - an overlay network that uses the Internet but requires a specific software, configurations or authorization to access. (Greenberg, 2015)</p>

                    <p>The dark web is known for its bad reputation due to it being somewhat of a safe haven for illegal activity such as illegal trade, forums, media exchange for pedophiles and terrorits due. (Rolling Stone, 2015)</p>

                                <li><strong>Distribution of child pornography</strong>: Prior to technology, the distribution of child pornography was limited due to it having to be of a more physical thing such as physical photographs, film, video, painting, drawings. Unlike technology which is not physical.

                                    <p><strong>Black markets</strong>: With the use of the Dark Web, the access of illegal products are now easier to obtain. Illegal products such as illegal drugs, weapons, prostitution, counterfeit items, etc are now available to be obtained by the click of a button.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Commercial darknet markets, which mediate transactions for illegal drugs and other goods, attracted significant media coverage starting with the popularity of Silk Road and Diabolus Market and its subsequent seizure by legal authorities. (Burleigh, 2015)</p>

                                    <p><strong>Child Pornography</strong>: 
                                    Technology, the internet has changed how child pornography is reproduced and shared and, according to the United States Department of Justice, it resulted in a massive increase in the "availability, accessibility, and volume of child pornography." The production of child pornography has become very profitable and is no longer limited to paedophiles due to the easy access from the internet. (Department of Justice, 2008)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Digital cameras and Internet distribution facilitated by the use of credit cards and the ease of transferring images across national borders has made it easier than ever before for users of child pornography to obtain the photographs and videos. (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, 2007)

                                    <p> <strong>Fraud Services</strong>: Fraud services such as counterfeit services, carding websites.</p>

                                    <p>Carding refers not only to payment card based fraud, but also to a range of related activities and services. Carding is a term describing the trafficking of credit card, bank account and other personal information online as well as related fraud services. (Schwartz, 2015) </p>

                                    <p>Fraud-As-A-Service is where users can purchase DDoS attacks, stolen payment cards, stolen identities and medical records, and social media/hacked accounts. (Richard, 2017)</p>
