                    <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. (Greenberg, 2014)</p>

                                    <p><strong>Money Laundering</strong>: The semi-anonymous and decentralized nature of many cryptocurrencies has meant that authorities fear that certain platforms could be used for money laundering. For example, as early as April 2012 the FBI indicated that the lack of regulation could mean that Bitcoin could be used for illegal activities by criminals, especially when offshore exchanges were available. (Norry, 2018)
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Users can also purchase "washing" services from the dark web to launder cryptocurrency then trade it for physical currency.</p>

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p><strong>Criminal Transactions</strong>: The cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, gained the attention of the US and international authorities as a result of its popularity among traders on the Dark Web. For example, the infamous Silk Road marketplace only accepted Bitcoin on its site in order to ensure anonymity for its customers. The infamy of the Silk Road, and the subsequent closing down of the marketplace by the FBI, to US Senator Charles Schumer explicitly referring to Bitcoin as a “surrogate currency” that enabled criminal activities. (Norry, 2018)
                                    
                                    <p>Due to its anonymity, criminals are salivating over bitcoin and other mainstream cryptocurrencies. Due to its virtual state making it easy to move around and stay anonymous.</p>
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p><strong>Extortion</strong>: In 2016, the FBI estimated that the ransomware industry took in US$1 billion – and that’s only the cases officials know about. All that money isn’t paid in cash. Before digital currencies existed, extortionists asked victims to send money by more formal transfer companies like Western Union or make deposits to bank accounts. Those were easily traced. Today, ransomware attacks demand payment in bitcoin, systems praised by supporters for their transaction speed and protection of users’ anonymity. (Kshetri, 2017)
                                    
                                    <p>When extortionists are paid using bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies - it is difficult to trace, therefore, making it difficult to find the offenders. </p>
